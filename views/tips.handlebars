                it.</li>
              <li>Take photos of your children's art, only keep your favorite, discard the rest.</li>

            <h3>Closet/Storage</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Organize drawers in a manner similar to a Bento box; compact and cozy.</li>
              <li>Before thinking of where to store anything, first consider discarding it.</li>
              <li>Hang clothes so that they rise to the right.</li>
              <li>Light materials such as cotton should be kept in the upper drawers and thick, heavy materials, such as
                wool, in the lower drawers.</li>
              <li>In general, dark colors should be in the back of the drawer and light colors in the front.</li>
              <li>Arrange your accessories so that the inside of your drawer looks like a showcase.</li>
              <li>Avoid putting items in plastic bags because it will make them appear as garbage. Instead, put them in
                a beautiful bag you really like.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Office</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Valuables are the one category where practicality, not the joy factor, takes priority when selecting
                what to keep.</li>
              <li>Because they are valuable, they have a fair bit of pride and should be stored with respect.</li>
              <li>You can clear your mind simply by discarding all unnecessary papers. Keep the desk area relatively
                clear.</li>
              <li>Don't make your office solely practical. It's important to add a playful touch precisely because it's
                a work space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Kitchen</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Make the dishes you love the ones you use every day. Unpack them and stack them in your cupboard.</li>
              <li>Place knives, forks, spoons, and chopsticks in their own compartments within a cutlery tray.</li>
              <li>Pick a cutlery tray made of rattan, bamboo, or some other natural material with a gentle embrace,
                rather than a plastic in which it will rattle around.</li>
              <li>When storing, stack similarly shaped items inside each other, such as pots with pots and bowls with
                bowls, so that you make the most of the cupboard's height.</li>
              <li>Nothing should be kept near the sink, not even your dish detergent or sponge.</li>
              <li>The basic rule is to discard anything that is past the expiration date.</li>
              <li>When in doubt, ask yourself whether it would spark joy to cook something with it.</li>
              <li>Store things together is a basic recommendation. For example, if you don't use small packages of
                seasonings that often, try emptying them into jars, one for each seasoning.</li>
              <li>Plastic bags should be flattened, folded, and stored upright just like clothes to prevent
                overstocking.</li>
              <li>You can also store plastic bags in a compact box that keeps them from expanding. The container should
                be half the size of a tissue box.</li>

                stored be folded and stored upright, not stuffed in a bag.</li>
              <li>If there's not enough space, you can make a special corner for them in your closet or on a shelf where
